# Typir Change Log

We roughly follow the ideas of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
Note that the versions "0.x.0" probably will include breaking changes.


## v0.1.2 (December 2024)

- Replaced absolute paths in READMEs by relative paths, which is a requirement for correct links on NPM


## v0.1.1 (December 2024)

- Improved the READMEs in the packages `typir` and `typir-langium`.
- Improved the CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Improved source code for Tiny Typir in `api-example.test.ts`.


## v0.1.0 (December 2024)

This is the first official release of Typir.
It serves as first version to experiment with Typir and to gather feedback to guide and improve the upcoming versions. We are looking forward to your feedback!
