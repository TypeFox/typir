/**
 * An edge has a direction (from --> to) and can be querried from both types (incomingEdge, outgoingEdge).
 * Between the same from and to nodes, edges with different $relations are allowed, but not multiple edges with the same $relation (in the same direction).
 *
 * Bidirectional relationships are represented by a single edge in the type graph,
 * otherwise information stored along these edges must be duplicated and maintained.
 * Edges don't contain explicit information, wether they are unidirectional or bidirectional, since it is semantically encoded in the $relation.
 * Users of edges who know about the $relation also know, whether the corresponding edges are unidirectional or bidirectional.
 * Graph algorithms also know, whether they work on unidirectional or on bidirectional edges.
 *
 * Edges are realized as interfaces (and not as classes), since there are no methods to reuse or to override for customizations.
