/**
 * The purpose of a TypeInitializer is to ensure, that the same type is created and registered only _once_ in the type system.
 * This class is used during the use case, when a type declaration in the AST exists,
 * for which a corresponding new Typir type needs to be established in the type system ("create new type").
 *
 * Without checking for duplicates, the same type might be created twice, e.g. in the following scenario:
 * If the creation of A is delayed, since a type B which is required for some properties of A is not yet created, A will be created not now, but later.
 * During the "waiting time" for B, another declaration in the AST might be found with the same Typir type A.
 * (The second declaration might be wrong, but the user expects to get a validation hint, and not Typir to crash, or the current DSL might allow duplicated type declarations.)
 * Since the first Typir type is not yet in the type systems (since it still waits for B) and therefore remains unknown,
 * it will be tried to create A a second time, again delayed, since B is still not yet available.
 * When B is created, A is waiting twice and might be created twice, if no TypeInitializer is used.
 *
 * Design decision: While this class does not provide some many default implementations,
 * a common super class (or interface) of all type initializers is useful,
 * since they all can be used as TypeSelector in an easy way.
