# Typir: Core functionality of Typir

Typir is a library for type systems and type checking for software languages in the web.

Typir is OpenSource, written in TypeScript, and follows pragmatic approaches for simplifying type checking in practical language engineering projects by providing default implementations for recurring problems.
As a stand-alone library, Typir provides a TypeScript-API for language engineers without an additional, external DSL for formalizing types.


## Installation

```bash
npm install typir
```


## Documentation

For an overview about the core features of Typir with a simple application example, see the [root README.md of the Typir project](/README.md).

Important design decision:
Typir is a stand-alone library and has no dependencies to any existing language workbench.
