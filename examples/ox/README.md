# Typir applied to OX

OX is a reduced version of [LOX](../lox/) in order to demonstrate type checking with [Typir](https://typir.org/) for primitives, functions and operators only.

For examples written in OX, look at some [collected examples](./examples/) or the [test cases](./test/).

Start experimenting with OX by executing the "Run Extension (OX)" launch configuration.
